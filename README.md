# Website-a-Day

"Website-a-Day" is a personal daily challenge to tackle designing and developing a free form website based of an idea that is of interest to me.

My aim for this challenge to do most of the coding by hand as much as possible and refrain from using plugins and existing code bits. I'll eventually attempt to learn how to implement existing frameworks as part of the learning process, but I'll keep it as vanilla as possible for the time being!
